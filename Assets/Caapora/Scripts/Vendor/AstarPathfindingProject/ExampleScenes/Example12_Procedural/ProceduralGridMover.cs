/** Moves a grid graph to follow a target.
 *
 * Attach this to some object in the scene and assign the target to e.g the player.
 * Then the graph will follow that object around as it moves.
 *
 * This is useful if pathfinding is only necessary in a small region around an object (for example the player).
 * It makes it possible to have vast open worlds (maybe procedurally generated) and still be able to use pathfinding on them.
 *
 * When the graph is moved you may notice an fps drop.
 * If this grows too large you can try a few things:
 * - Reduce the #updateDistance. This will make the updates smaller but more frequent.
 *   This only works to some degree however since an update has an inherent overhead.
 * - Turn off erosion on the grid graph. This will reduce the number of nodes that need updating.
 * - Reduce the grid size.
 * - Turn on multithreading (A* Inspector -> Settings)
 * - Disable Height Testing or Collision Testing in the grid graph. This can give a minor performance boost.
 *
 * \see Take a look at the example scene called "Procedural" for an example of how to use this script
 *
 * \version Since 3.6.8 this class can handle graph rotation other options such as isometric angle and aspect ratio.
